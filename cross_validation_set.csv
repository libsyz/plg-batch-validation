Challenge:**  
When setting up a new laptop, this customer, who recently signed up for Microsoft 365 Business was prompted to sign in with a ""Microsoft account."" However, this prompt refers to personal Microsoft accounts (e.g., Outlook.com, Gmail, or Hotmail), not the Microsoft 365 Business work or school accounts they signed up with. This discrepancy leads to confusion and frustration, as he repeatedly attempts to use his business account only to receive an invalid account error.



**Impact:**  
This creates a poor first impression for business users, adding unnecessary barriers during the setup process. Customers may feel frustrated, lose confidence in the platform, or reach out for support, increasing the time and effort needed to complete the onboarding process. It can negatively impact customer satisfaction and lead to a perception that the service is complicated or not user-friendly.



**Recommendation for Improvement:**  
Microsoft should revise the setup instructions to explicitly clarify the type of account required at this step. For instance, the prompt could specify: *""Enter your personal Microsoft account (e.g., Outlook.com, Gmail, Hotmail). If you are using a work or school account, please sign in later through the Microsoft 365 Business portal.""* Additionally, a help link or tooltip could be included to guide users who might be unsure.

The current sign-up message for Microsoft 365 Business Standard creates confusion for users who do not have a work or school email address. The challenge lies in the phrasing, which implies that only work or school email accounts can be used, leading some customers to believe personal email accounts, such as Gmail or Outlook, are not acceptable. Additionally, users with an existing Microsoft 365 Business account face unclear instructions when entering their email, as they are prompted to sign in rather than set up a new account.



This lack of clarity impacts the customer experience by potentially deterring prospective users from completing the sign-up process, causing frustration and lost opportunities for engagement. Customers may feel uncertain about what type of email address to use or may abandon the sign-up altogether due to unclear messaging.



To improve this, the recommendation is to revise the sign-up instructions to explicitly state that both personal and work/school email accounts are acceptable. For example, the message could read: ""Enter your email address—this can be a work, school, or personal account (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)."" Additionally, for users with an existing account, provide clear guidance on signing in versus creating a new account to avoid confusion. These changes would ensure a smoother and more inclusive onboarding experience, reducing barriers and enhancing user satisfaction.",1,Valid,No data submitted,0,No data submitted,"Copilot Value add:
